# utilities for the training pipeline
"""
Utility helpers used across the training codebase.

- ``mkdir`` – ensure a directory exists (creates parent directories as needed).
- ``save_json`` – write a Python object to a JSON file (pretty‑printed, UTF‑8).
- ``load_json`` – read a JSON file and return the deserialized Python object.

All functions raise informative ``OSError`` / ``json.JSONDecodeError``
exceptions which can be caught by callers.
